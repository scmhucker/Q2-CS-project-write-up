# Q2-CS-project-write-up

Hello!
 
This program is a casino simulation called Casino Royale where we try to teach how random number generators function (RNG), how conditions can change everything, and make a money-free gambling game with various casino activities. This should help with things like learning and keeping it fun without the risk of anything lost or addiction. It also should help with managing money by training you to not spend it all on one thing or to just make bad decisions.
